        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Albert Einstein:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Albert Einstein is a celebrated scientist in the 20th century. He’s
            famous for his discovery of the Theory of Relativity. And he paved
            the way for a branch of physics.
          </li>
          <p>Here are other reasons his greatness is worth celebrating:</p>
          <li>
            Free thinking philosophy – He was a genius. And he spoke with
            thoroughness and eloquence on a range of important humanitarian
            issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexible adviser – He advised Franklin Roosevelt about the power of
            nuclear physics. But later on, he advised against it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Relentless determination – Although his educators thought of him as
            dim-witted, he never doubted his ability to learn. And so, he
            ventured into independent learning and taught himself math.
          </li>
          <p>
            Another fascinating thing about Albert Einstein is his ambitious
            spirit. On his own, he made significant scientific discoveries,
            published prominent works, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics
            (1921). With all that he is, you could see why Michael Hart
            considers him the 10th influential person.
